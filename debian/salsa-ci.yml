#FIXME: upon first enabling salsa-CI, the blhc test is failing I'm afraid I
#       (Philip Hands) don't know if setting hardening flags is a good idea for
#       busybox, so I'll leave it as it is for now, and set `allow_failure`
#       below.
#
#       If/when someone sets the hardening flags successfully, this setting
#       should go. On the other hand, if it's inappropriate to set them, then
#       this comment can also go and one can disable the test by adding this to
#       the variables section above:
#
#         SALSA_CI_DISABLE_BLHC: 1

  allow_failure: true
